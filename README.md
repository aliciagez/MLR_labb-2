Labb 2 maskininlärnings ramverk


Backround: 
Before i did this bu using wsl and ubuntu but now i am doing this om a diffrent machine and thus have to use a very specifc toml for it to work on windows. 

Loading data: 
There was alot of good information on the dataset CIFAR-10 on the offical documentations on pytorch and so that was helpfull on how to load the data without physiclay put the data in the project which i almost did.
